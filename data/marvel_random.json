    "Killer Shrike": "Formerly a U.S. soldier who became a mercenary specializing in covert operations, Simon Maddicks was hired by the Brand Corporation, a subsidiary of the Roxxon Oil Company, who subjected him to bionic treatments and gave him the costumed identity of the Killer Shrike. Roxxon Oil had Shrike infiltrate a rival shadow organization, the Conspiracy, who continued to make large purchases from the Brand Corp.",

    "Kronos": "While working on a scientific experiment with cosmic energy, he accidentally created an explosion, destroying Titanos as well as himself. However, his mind was still active and merged himself with time and the universe. Soon enough this scientist will create himself and without thinking he will try to take all the cosmic energy and use it to destroy the universe.",
    "Kraven the Hunter": "Kraven was a maniacal big game hunter who sought to defeat Spider-Man to prove that he was the greatest hunter in the world. Unlike other hunters, he typically disdained the use of guns or bow and arrows preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands even though he often made elaborate preparations to weaken a quarry before hand. He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler.",
    "Korvac": "Born in the year 2977 AD of the alternate timeline Earth-691, Michael Korvac would be born in many forms over time, all of them powerful and dangerous. As an adult, he became a gifted “computer techno” (technician), but grew bitter due to his belief that superiors did not appreciate his abilities. When the extraterrestrial Brotherhood of the Badoon conquered Earth and its colony worlds circa 3006-3007, Korvac served the new Badoon regime as a willing collaborator, and was soon placed in charge of analytical computer systems regulating entire planets; however, his new masters worked him to the point of exhaustion.",
    "Korg": "Native to the planet Ria, the Kronans are a highly-advanced race who developed space-travel technology thousands of years ago (shortly after creating the Gravitron, a device installed upon all Kronan starships that enable them to defy the laws of gravity).
